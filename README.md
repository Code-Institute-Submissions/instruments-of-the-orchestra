## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive quiz aimed at school children that will allow them to learn about the different instruments used in an orchestra. Throughout the quiz, the user will learn more about the different instruments and instrument families in the orchestra by being presented with a fact when they answer a question correctly. If a user answers incorrectly, they will be asked to try again until they choose the correct answer. The quiz is designed to be a learning tool and doesn't keep a score of the questions the user has answered correctly. By creating this website, I hope to help school children learn more about the orchestra and hope to encourage more interest in music.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

#### Typography

#### Imagery

To make the background of the site more fun and appealing for the user, I drew some music notes and other music related symbols using [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad) on an iPad.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for my site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Links to the wireframes can be found below:

## Testing

Created a branch to updated the text content of the answer buttons from the object array in a different wat. With the first version where I looped through the array to updated the text, I was unable to find a way to see if the button clicked was true or false.
