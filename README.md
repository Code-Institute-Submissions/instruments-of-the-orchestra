## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive quiz aimed at school children that will allow them to learn about the different instruments used in an orchestra. Throughout the quiz, the user will learn more about the different instruments and instrument families in the orchestra by being presented with a fact when they answer a question correctly. If a user answers incorrectly, they will be asked to try again until they choose the correct answer. The quiz is designed to be a learning tool and doesn't keep a score of the questions the user has answered correctly. By creating this quiz, I hope to help school children learn more about the orchestra and encourage them to take an interest in music.

### User Goals

- As a **user**, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site on my first visit
- As a **user**, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site
- As a **user**, I want to learn about the different instruments used in an orchestra
- As a **user**, I want to have a fun playing the quiz and also have fun learning
- As a **user**, I want to be able to easily contact the site owner to provide feedback about the quiz
- As a **user**, I want to see what other projects the site owner has created

### Site Owner Goals

- As a **site owner**, I want the user to be greeted with a welcome message with a short explanation on what the site is so the user instantly understands the purpose of the site
- As a **site owner**, I want to include links on all pages of the site to allow the user to easily navigate to other pages
- As a **site owner**, I want to create a quiz that will teach the user about the different instruments used in an orchestra
- As a **site owner**, I want to create a fun and interactive experience for the user that will engage them throughout
- As a **site owner**, I want to include a feedback form to allow the user to easily contact me and leave feedback about the quiz and/or the website itself
- As a **site owner**, I want to include links to my GitHub profile and my LinkedIn profile so the user can see other projects I've worked on

### Design

As this project is aimed at school children, I wanted to create a fun and colorful design that will engage the user and keep them interested throughout.

The layout of the site is simple and easy to follow with navigation buttons at the top, the main content in the middle and social/contact buttons in the footer. The overall site is made up of two pages:

- index.html - This includes the welcome message and all the quiz content
- contact.html - This includes the feedback form

#### Colour Scheme

![Color Scheme Generated by coolors.co](assets/images/color-palette/color-palette-light.jpg)

![Color Scheme Generated by coolors.co](assets/images/color-palette/color-palette-dark.jpg)

Generated colour schemes using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f94144-f67584-f8961e-f9c74f-90be6d-43aab1-264653)

#### Typography

Throughout the site, I used two fonts - [ABeeZee Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/ABeeZee?preview.text_type=custom&query=abee) and [Grandstander Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Grandstander?preview.text_type=custom&category=Display,Handwriting,Monospace&query=grand).

I chose the ABeeZee font as it was described as a font suitable for children that is simple and easy to read. It is used as the main font throughout the site:

>"ABeeZee is a children's learning font. Open, friendly and simple, the definite shapes support the process of learning to read and write. The italic carefully reminds young readers of fluent writing movements and inspires them to create their own unique handwriting."

I used the Grandstander font for the headings throughout the site as well as the quiz questions. I chose this font as it was easy to read but also sort of 'fun' looking which will hopefully make the site more appealing to the user.

#### Imagery

To make the background of the site more fun and appealing for the user, I drew some music notes and other music related symbols using [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad) on an iPad.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for my site were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

The final design of the site closely follows the wireframe designs with the exception of following only one style of the quiz questions shown. This was due to some issues adding audio to only a few of the quiz questions in the initial phase of the project build. Instead, all the questions now include an audio source that can be played when the user answers the question correctly to hear what sound that specific instrument makes.

Links to the wireframes can be found below:

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to validate the html and css files in the project and to ensure there were no syntax errors. The following shows the results for each file:

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - index.html - No errors or warnings to show.
  - contact.html - Nor errors or warnings to show.

Upon running both html files through the validator for the first time, warnings were displayed for the use of "type" in the script tags. After removing these, both html files passed through the validator without any errors or warnings.

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  - styles.css - No error found.
  - The validator did display a warning for the use of the root colour variable names.

![Valid CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue)

JS Hint was used to check the javascript files in the project to ensure it complies with coding rules and that these were no syntax errors:

- [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/)
  - quiz.js - No warnings to show.
  - feedback.js - Found one undefined variable (emailjs) and one unused variable (sendMail).

Upon running both JavaScript files through JS Hint, there were a number of warnings for missing semicolons. There were also two warnings for the use of single quotes when calling the number dataset in quiz.js. After adding the relevant semicolons and replacing the single quotes with template literals, this fixed this issues in quiz.js and feedback.js.

### Further Testing

As well as running each page through a validator and testing user stories, I also tested the responsiveness of the site across a number of different devices and browsers:

- The site was tested during the development process using Chrome DevTools to test the responsiveness on different devices before pushing any changes to GitHub.
- After pushing any changes, the site was also tested in Chrome, Safari and FireFox

As well as testing the responsiveness of the site, I also tested the performance of each page using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools. The scores for each page can be found below:

### Known Bugs

Issue with audio repeating/playing at the same time as other audio clip when button is clicked in initial script - fixed with latest version.

Issue with question count - fixed with changing where getQuestions function was called

Created a branch to update the text content of the answer buttons from the object array in a different way. With the first version - I looped through the array to update the text, I was unable to find a way to see if the button clicked was true or false.

## Credits

### Code

The JavaScript code used to create the quiz was based around two tutorials found on YouTube. I originally started basing the code on the [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) video on how to [Build a Quiz App with Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=PLyn9ak24qaCvBSsurq-Q1fGKEXXUzsJmf&index=2&t=718s) before discovering [James Q Quicks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-T8W79DN6PBnzomelvqJYw) video on how to [Build a Quiz App (3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdQGs62cR8&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=5). This approach worked better for the type of quiz I was aiming to build for this project.

Other tutorials and code examples used in the project:

- [W3 Schools: How to Animate Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_buttons_animate3) - This was used to add a "pressed" effect to all buttons throughout the site.

- [W3: Favicon](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon) - This was used to learn how to add a favicon to the site.

- [JavaScript Info: Fisher-Yates Shuffle](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle) - This was initially used to try a different approach to shuffle the questions array before settling on using math functions instead.

- [FreeCodeCamp: Button Loop](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-the-art-of-looping-in-javascript-with-these-incredible-tricks-a5da1aa1d6c5/) - This was initially used to test different ways of looping through buttons to see which worked best for updating the inner text of the buttons.

### Content

- All content on the site was written by the developer
- The README.md is based on the Code Institute sample README

### Media

#### Sound

- All sounds were taken from [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/)
- All audio files were compressed using [Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/compress-mp3)

#### Images

- The background image used on this site was created using [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad) on an iPad.
- As this project is for educational purposes, images have been used from a variety of sites as it was difficult to find all the images needed for the quiz on royalty free image sites. Links to these resources can be found below.
- Images were resized to have either the same dimensions or similar dimensions using [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)
- Images were optimised for web using [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) and [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - this excludes the background image as this appeared pixilated when compressed.

**Image Resources**:

- The vector icons used for the favicon, in the about modal and throughout the quiz are from [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
